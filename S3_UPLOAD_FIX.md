# S3 Upload Error Fix - Complete Solution

## 🚨 Problem

The pt-admin application was experiencing S3 upload errors:

```
S3 Upload Error: NetworkingError: Network Failure
```

### Root Causes:
1. **Direct Browser-to-S3 Uploads**: Frontend was uploading files directly to AWS S3
2. **Exposed AWS Credentials**: AWS access keys were required in the frontend environment
3. **CORS Issues**: Browser security restrictions causing network failures
4. **Security Risk**: AWS credentials exposed in client-side code

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (pt-backend)

Created secure file upload API endpoints:

#### New Files:
- `src/controllers/upload.controller.ts` - Handles file uploads and presigned URLs
- `src/routes/upload.routes.ts` - Defines upload API routes

#### API Endpoints:

1. **Single File Upload**
   ```
   POST /api/upload
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
   Body: multipart/form-data
     - file: File
     - type: "thumbnail" | "mockup" | "variant" | "gridline"
   
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: {
       key: string,
       url: string,
       signedUrl: string,
       _id: string
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Files Upload**
   ```
   POST /api/upload/multiple
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
   Body: multipart/form-data
     - files: File[] (max 10 files)
     - type: "thumbnail" | "mockup" | "variant" | "gridline"
   
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: [{
       key: string,
       url: string,
       signedUrl: string,
       _id: string
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Get Presigned URL**
   ```
   POST /api/upload/presigned-url
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
   Body: {
     key: string
   }
   
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: {
       signedUrl: string
     }
   }
   ```

#### Features:
- ✅ Authenticated endpoints (requires login)
- ✅ File validation (only images)
- ✅ Automatic image optimization
- ✅ 10MB file size limit
- ✅ Detailed error logging
- ✅ Presigned URLs for secure viewing

### Frontend Changes (pt-admin)

Updated upload utilities to use API:

#### New Files:
- `utils/apiUpload.ts` - New secure API-based upload functions

#### Modified Files:
- `utils/s3Upload.ts` - Now uses API instead of direct S3
- `env.example` - Updated documentation

#### Key Changes:
```typescript
// OLD (Direct S3 - INSECURE)
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION,
});

// NEW (API-based - SECURE)
export const uploadToS3ViaAPI = async (file: File, type: string) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);
  formData.append("type", type);
  
  const response = await apiClient.post("/upload", formData);
  return response.data.data;
};
```

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:

```
User selects file in browser
         ↓
Frontend: apiUpload.uploadToS3ViaAPI()
         ↓
POST /api/upload (with authentication)
         ↓
Backend: upload.controller.ts
         ↓
Validates file & user authentication
         ↓
S3Service.uploadOptimizedImage()
         ↓
Uploads to S3 with optimization
         ↓
Generates presigned URL for preview
         ↓
Returns file info to frontend
         ↓
Frontend displays uploaded image
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Security:
- ✅ **No AWS credentials in frontend** - All credentials stay on backend
- ✅ **Authenticated uploads** - Only logged-in users can upload
- ✅ **Server-side validation** - Backend checks file types and sizes
- ✅ **Controlled access** - Presigned URLs with expiration

### Reliability:
- ✅ **No CORS issues** - All requests go through same-origin API
- ✅ **Better error handling** - Clear error messages from backend
- ✅ **Automatic retries** - Backend can implement retry logic
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - Works across all browsers

### Performance:
- ✅ **Image optimization** - Backend optimizes images before upload
- ✅ **File size limits** - Prevents oversized uploads
- ✅ **Batch uploads** - Multiple files in one request
- ✅ **Efficient presigned URLs** - 1-hour expiration, can be refreshed

## 📋 Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment:

1. **Ensure AWS credentials are configured in backend environment:**
   ```bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=your_region
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   ```

2. **Deploy backend** - The new endpoints will be automatically available

3. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://printrove-api.vizdale.com/api/upload \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -F "file=@test.jpg" \
     -F "type=thumbnail"
   ```

### Frontend Deployment:

1. **No new environment variables needed!** (This is the point - no AWS creds)

2. **Existing env vars:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://printrove-api.vizdale.com/api
   ```

3. **Deploy frontend** - Uploads will now use the API automatically

4. **Test uploads** - Try uploading images in product creation

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Single Upload:
1. Log in to admin panel
2. Go to product creation
3. Upload a thumbnail image
4. Should see success message
5. Image should display with presigned URL

### Test Multiple Uploads:
1. Go to variant creation
2. Upload multiple variant images
3. All images should upload successfully
4. Check console for logs

### Check Logs:
- **Backend logs** should show:
  - "Upload request received"
  - "Uploading file: filename.jpg, type: thumbnail"
  - "File uploaded successfully: temp/thumbnails/..."

- **Frontend console** should show:
  - "Uploading file via API: filename.jpg"
  - "Upload successful: { key, url, signedUrl }"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If uploads still fail:

1. **Check backend logs** for error messages
2. **Verify AWS credentials** are set in backend environment
3. **Check S3 bucket permissions** - Backend needs write access
4. **Verify authentication** - Make sure user is logged in
5. **Check file size** - Must be under 10MB
6. **Check file type** - Must be an image

### Common Errors:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "No file provided" | File not sent correctly | Check FormData construction |
| "Only image files are allowed" | Wrong file type | Upload only images |
| "AWS credentials not configured" | Missing env vars | Set AWS env vars in backend |
| "Authentication required" | Not logged in | Log in to admin panel |
| "File too large" | Over 10MB | Compress image before upload |

## 📊 Monitoring

### Metrics to Track:
- Upload success rate
- Upload duration
- File sizes
- Error types
- API response times

### Logs to Monitor:
- Backend: `logger.info("File uploaded successfully")`
- Backend: `logger.error("Error uploading file")`
- Frontend: Console logs for upload attempts

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1. **Remove aws-sdk from frontend** - No longer needed
2. **Add progress tracking** - Show upload progress to users
3. **Add file type restrictions** - Limit to specific image formats
4. **Implement chunked uploads** - For very large files
5. **Add upload queue** - Handle multiple uploads better
6. **Cache presigned URLs** - Reduce API calls
7. **Add image compression in frontend** - Before upload
